Started working on the landscape. I'm going to treat this like a Bob Ross painting and put my money where my mouth is. 
The mind will fill any lacking details. Must prevent burning myself out even more. I'll work on it when I want, no forcing.
Next step is to find my backup hd and import the buildings that I modelled for a previous attempt. They had some nice textures too.

Also no idea how big the landscape should be. If it's too big, people will get tired of running around. It wasn't very big in Gothic
and people got tired, but perhaps this was rather due to a lack of enemies on the way or other random encounters. The travel to the
mountain should take a while.

I want people to see the mountain from the village in the far distance. So I'm guessing it should be at least 1-1.5 kilometers away
which need to be filled with details.

First it's time for a walk. Every time I'm out in the woods my mind plays old rpg music. Everytime I come back I feel too 
claustrophobic to work. Perhaps it would be best to gamedev in the woods. Or in a garden.

Found the old houses. They were really basic but with some modifications they'll do.

Ok no. Not reusing old houses. These look like city houses, I want a primitive village.

Finally reinstalled Windows today. It was bugged from the start but I didn't care for months. Now for deving, 
I had to get it working again. Perhaps I'll model some more later today. I'm not sure about the way the hoses should look like.
Straw roofs? Rooftile roofs? Wooden rooftile roofs? No idea.
