Started working on the landscape. I'm going to treat this like a Bob Ross painting and put my money where my mouth is. 
The mind will fill any lacking details. Must prevent burning myself out even more. I'll work on it when I want, no forcing.
Next step is to find my backup hd and import the buildings that I modelled for a previous attempt. They had some nice textures too.

Also no idea how big the landscape should be. If it's too big, people will get tired of running around. It wasn't very big in Gothic
and people got tired, but perhaps this was rather due to a lack of enemies on the way or other random encounters. The travel to the
mountain should take a while.

I want people to see the mountain from the village in the far distance. So I'm guessing it should be at least 1-1.5 kilometers away
which need to be filled with details.
