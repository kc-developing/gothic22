This is a lax roadmap of what I'll do here.

I need a character animator, but since I don't know one, don't feel like socialising and don't have money to pay for one,
I'll start modelling the landscape first. I'll model it in Blender and make the trees in Speedtree. 
It will be a village in a valley between mountains, with some forest, ravines, caves and a lake, like in Gothic 2 near the black troll.

I will do this when I feel like it. Currently not so easy because my room and desk are all full of stuff and I hate sitting down.

The area will be quite large I think but I'll screw perfectionism and simply have wide undetailed planes whenever I don't have 
details for that area.
