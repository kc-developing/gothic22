**23rd Feb**

Started working on the landscape. I'm going to treat this like a Bob Ross painting and put my money where my mouth is. 
The mind will fill any lacking details. Must prevent burning myself out even more. I'll work on it when I want, no forcing.
Next step is to find my backup hd and import the buildings that I modelled for a previous attempt. They had some nice textures too.

Also no idea how big the landscape should be. If it's too big, people will get tired of running around. It wasn't very big in Gothic
and people got tired, but perhaps this was rather due to a lack of enemies on the way or other random encounters. The travel to the
mountain should take a while.

I want people to see the mountain from the village in the far distance. So I'm guessing it should be at least 1-1.5 kilometers away
which need to be filled with details.

First it's time for a walk. Every time I'm out in the woods my mind plays old rpg music. Everytime I come back I feel too 
claustrophobic to work. Perhaps it would be best to gamedev in the woods. Or in a garden.

Found the old houses. They were really basic but with some modifications they'll do.

Ok no. Not reusing old houses. These look like city houses, I want a primitive village.

Finally reinstalled Windows today. It was bugged from the start but I didn't care for months. Now for deving, 
I had to get it working again. Perhaps I'll model some more later today. I'm not sure about the way the hoses should look like.
Straw roofs? Rooftile roofs? Wooden rooftile roofs? No idea.

Well that's slightly worrying. I tried to make this house a bit fucked up. But it's not nearly as fucked as in Gothic. The beams... aren't right. Spent a lot of time on something that came out wrong. I should have looked at the role model a bit more often:

Let's not get lost in perfectionism, huh? Doesn't mean I can magically work at lightspeed. But I think tomorrow the tavern will be done. I'm happy I decided to make it bigger, this way I have enough space for the poor people's bedrooms and the suits. Actually there should be a sleeping hall too for the really poor people. Maybe I can turn one of the suits into the sleeping hall... that actually sounds like a decent idea, except I'm not sure who wants to sleep in a suit that has a whole group of people sleeping in the next room.

Also need to make it look shabbier tomorrow, though maybe I won't reach Gothic's level of shabbiness... will have to see. From shabbiness comes coziness. And perhaps I'll add a stable or some other building outside to make it look less rectangle-shaped.

What a shit day. But let's get started. Perhaps I can finish this tavern today. Furniture is scheduled for tomorrow.

**27th Feb**

Whew. I'll have to clean this up tomorrow.

Also you're a lousy audience, soon as I'm confident enough, I'll ditch you.
