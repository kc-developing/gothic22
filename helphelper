If anyone wants to join in, I could use the following low effort stuff:

 - Trees in Speedtree (actually - there may be better suited tree generators. Speedtree is very high poly from what I remember. It's unnecessary and might seem out of place.)
 - Spell animations like in Gothic... Fireballs and so on
 - I'd say music but I think for music I really want only top quality.
 - Sound effects
 
 I'll be working with Unity.
